                    <description>&lt;p&gt;The stories and headlines that we hear and see about North Korea could be enough to keep anyone from traveling to the country.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Or even the simple fact that Americans are generally NOT welcomed would be a clear warning to never travel there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But for our guest this week, that only enticed her more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This week, Wendy Simmons, professional photographer and worldwide traveler of over 85 countries, joins The James Altucher Show to share what is really going on in North Korea.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From the moment she entered the country to the day she left, she was assigned a handler to escort her every move.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With a "military-first" policy and the basic idea that nobody has free will... It's hard to believe that anybody would venture willingly into such a country.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here you will hear Wendy's first-hand experiences and the truth of what she has encountered.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Forget most of what you think you know... because in this interview, everything about the world's most militarized society is revealed in a new light.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

                    <description>&lt;p&gt;James says it's his worst interview ever and that he has never felt more awkward or embarrassed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We think it could be one of the best yet!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We decided to play off of the awkwardness and embarrassing moments in the interview and bring to you something we know you haven't heard anywhere else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enter, Biz Markie, hip-hop legend and James' hero.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are familiar with the hit song "Just a Friend" then you already know at least one of his many hits.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From making it as one of the top names in hip-hop to "choosing himself" and losing 150 pounds... Biz shares it all!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Most of people don't know about the many careers that Biz Markie has been able to master. He has gone from rapping to DJ-ing to acting to managing a business.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But what is really remarkable about him is his attitude... doing what he loves and not worrying about making millions. Money should just be a side effect of doing what you are truly passionate about.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For Biz, that is his many business ventures... He chose himself by having multiple sources of income to support all of his interests.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This interview gives listeners insight into his whole career inside and out. Was he a one-hit guy? Did he resent other rappers that went on to make millions later on? How did he reinvent himself to succeed in other careers?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How hard do you actually have to work and how many years of practice does it take?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you ever wondered how the hip-hop industry works, and what it takes to make it in a highly competitive field, then this is the show for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With all of his success and opportunities that he has had over the years, James asks Biz if he has any regrets. His answer is truly one to admire and one that a lot of individuals would not be able to say.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

                    <description>&lt;p&gt;Each week, we get to hear little snippets of James Altucher's life, but we never get the full story.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Today that changes. Today, Claudia turns the tables on James and interviews HIM. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you know James, you have heard him say that he has lost and made millions back and at times mention that he felt as if he was going to die.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So Claudia jumps right into the questions that so many of us want to know more about. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"Why were you going to die?"&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"People lose money every day... how many millions did you lose?"&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"How did you lose it? How did you make it back again?" &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;James reveals all the mistakes that led to his darkest moments... times where he thought he would never see the light again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Divorced, no job, completely broke, millions have been lost. When you feel that your children would be better off with your life-insurance policy instead of you... how do you come back from something like that?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And... James reveals a HUGE secret that nobody else knows... not even Claudia.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He has always been open and honest with his listeners and followers of his blog, twitter, and Facebook. But today EVERYTHING is revealed... absolutely nothing is off the table.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He was able to completely turn his life around... something that most individuals in the same type of situations would not be fortunate enough to do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;His success, triumph, and passion are truly admirable and could be inspiration to use toward your own life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is the ultimate "choose yourself" episode... &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enjoy.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

                    <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Noah Kagan, an American Internet entrepreneur and founder of AppSumo, joins The James Altucher Show.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Noah gets asked the same question every time he gives an interview... "Why were you fired from Facebook?"&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But today... he shares it all with James and you get to hear the real story.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Noah shares two secrets that he hasn't ever told in an interview before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He was fired as one of the first employees of Facebook and he left probably $100,000,000 behind if he had stayed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He tells James exactly what happened. Why he was fired. What he did afterwards. And... what he's doing now (its genius).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then... the interview veers in a different direction that changes James' life and maybe it will change yours as well. Noah tells James that one of the first steps to success is to get over your fears.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Noah presents James with a challenge. It may sound simple, but he encourages all of the listeners to go out and try it as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;IT'S UNCOMFORTABLE.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Going outside the comfort zone will put you in THE ZONE. THE ZONE is much bigger than the comfort zone. And James has found that he wants to live in THE ZONE even though it's scarier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You'll see that life is full of rejection, but what you learn from the experience is what will change your life for the better.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Tim joins The James Altucher Show to talk about how cutting stress&amp;hellip; Being mindful and aware of others is the number one way to create a less chaotic nation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just like James, Tim has created a daily practice for himself to exercise his idea muscle and figure out alternative routes to everyday problems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tim presents listeners with a simple strategy that when applied and practiced can help with any problems that you may have... &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We live in a world where there is a pill for any problem. Do we want to live in a society where our children, politicians, teachers, family, and friends are heavily medicated?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Or are there more effective and natural ways to heal our bodies and minds?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;James and Tim go through several techniques that everyone can use to better their lives with minimal amount of effort.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

                    <description>&lt;p&gt;Today, James interviews his close friend and author of Happy Endings: The Tales of a Meaty-Breasted Zilch, Jim Norton.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You may know Jim from his various appearances on shows or even his own stand-up routines. But what you don't know is the process behind all his achievements.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here is where you meet the real Jim Norton. You'll learn how he overcame the darkest part of his life and decided to rise above it all and "choose himself."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just like James, Jim found it difficult to perform in front of an audience, but he shares his strategy for connecting and building a quick rapport with a crowd.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He gives several other tactics that have helped him overcome the anxiety and doubt that builds during his shows. His examples could be approaches that help you cure your own stage fright.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Something that James and Jim both believe in is honesty. An audience responds to honesty and it's what will always work in your favor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not only will it free you from guilt and stress, it will protect you if the truth is ever questioned in the future. To have a true connection and respectability with your fans, you need to hide nothing from them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Get ready to see a side of comedy that is not revealed very often...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enjoy!&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/p&gt;</description>

His first passion in life was getting rich, and today you get the real story about his success.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was more than just aspiration &amp;ndash; Mark says it was about putting in the time and the desire to be self-employed and an entrepreneur that really drove his passion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What started as the motivation to simply survive his monthly bills turned into a life he could not have imagined.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From his first college bar to MicroSolutions (the first company that he sold), you'll get the inside scoop on how his business ventures started and then soared to epic proportions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Plus, Mark goes into detail about his recent case with the SEC, and talks about the influence that the case had on the creation of Cyber Dust.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It will surely make you think twice about sending your next text, email, tweet, or any communication over the internet.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

                    <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Divorce, success, failure, struggle... are these excuses or stepping stones?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Today's guest has been through many situations similar to our host, James Altucher.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like James, Steve Scott has made his passions a reality by going around the gatekeepers of industries and finding a way to "choose himself."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Steve has written a variety of books that deliver step-by-step strategies you can immediately implement to improve your life and business strategies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You'll quickly learn that what separates Steve from many others is his unique ability to break down barriers and explain complex topics in a no-nonsense, straight forward way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You would think that having a failed marriage, losing his house, and moving back in with his parents would have slowed his success and willpower. However, for Steve, that is simply not the case... in fact, it has only pushed his drive and focus even further.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here is your shortcut in life... There is no holding back in this interview. Steve shares all the secrets and shortcuts that have brought him success.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This month alone he is already set to make $40,000... all from the comfort of his home and at his own leisurely schedule.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are two strategies that Steve follows, and he explains why there is no need for any others... It could be your new business philosophy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enjoy!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

                    <description>&lt;p&gt;This week James hosts his good friend and best-selling author of The 4-Hour Workweek, Tim Ferriss.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before every interview, James spends hours reviewing his guest's work so he can come up with something different and something very special.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This interview proved to be the most difficult in regard to preparation, so far. Not because Tim Ferriss doesn't have anything interesting to talk about (quite the opposite), but because James didn't want to ask him the same old questions he gets asked on every interview. "Can you really only work 4 hours a week?" "Did you really do the things you wrote about?" "Is it actually possible to get the results that you did?" Blah, Blah, Blah.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tim Ferriss has done many different, interesting things besides writing his "4 hour series," and James explores many of those passions on this podcast.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And don't worry, this isn't "The 4 Hour Podcast." But almost.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

                    <description>&lt;p&gt;We are doing something a little different this week. There isn't a guest, but there will be a heated debate between James and Aaron.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It's a sensitive topic for many individuals, so get ready...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kids that are graduating high school right now are beginning to apply for college. Unfortunately, they could be making one of the biggest mistakes of their lives.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hundreds of dollars of student debt, little to no job opportunities &amp;ndash; these are the realities of today's college graduate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;James takes some of the most popular arguments for why kids should go to college and turns them on their head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It's the American religion that kids should go to college... but is it necessary?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What are the reasons for going to college? Is it to network and meet people?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Couldn't you do the same by taking a year off and traveling? Not only would you get to see the world, meet people from all walks of life, but you would be gaining knowledge and experiences that could NEVER be taught in a classroom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will you make more money if you go to college?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do you want to be a writer? Why not write a book for free and self-publish?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are many ways around almost every gate-keeper out there... Why not get a head start on your fellow "classmates" and skip the debt process?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sure you learn certain things in college, but the real question is, "what are you NOT learning?"...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Whether you are a student or the parent of a student, listening to this episode is a must...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And even if you are neither, these children are the future of the country and they will affect the direction this country goes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It's a fantastic show that will certainly have you rethinking your goals in life.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

But it needn't be this way. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is a formula for success that has been followed by the icons of history &amp;ndash; from John D. Rockefeller to Amelia Earhart to Ulysses S. Grant to Steve Jobs &amp;ndash; a formula that let them turn obstacles into opportunities. The Obstacle Is The Way contains that formula and will be your manual for facing adversity and turning it into the triumphs we all seek.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you can't handle the minor obstacles, how are you going to handle the major dilemmas?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here is your chance to get an inside look from the author himself... There is a formula to turn negative situations into positive ones and James and Ryan reveal the secret.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;James asks Ryan, why this book and why now?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"I believe that you write the book that you have to write. This is that book for me. I first discovered the Stoic exercise of turning obstacles upside down when I was 19 years old. Since then, it has been seared into my brain regardless of what I've done, and I've always tried to think about my problems and opportunities in life through that frame. It has helped me become successful, just as it helped countless people before me. The Obstacle Is The Way reveals that framework for the first time &amp;ndash; and shows you how to turn your trials and tribulations into opportunities."&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Willpower is pointless!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do you agree? If you do then you will love this interview with Publisher and CEO of Owner Magazine, Chris Brogan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;James brings Chris on as a guest to talk about his new book, The Freaks Shall Inherit the Earth: Entrepreneurship for Weirdos, Misfits, and World Dominators.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He breaks down what willpower really is... just our brains' programming language.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just like James does in his upcoming book, The Power of No, Chris discusses how to use discipline with our willpower and to learn that smarter no's lead to better yesses...&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How do you avoid getting stuck in "plan-ville?" How will you launch these great ideas that have inspired you?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;James and Chris talk about how to turn your passions into businesses...&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Are you still playing it safe? Scared to take that plunge and trust your ideas?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is an excellent "Choose Yourself" episode that gives you that nudge of reassurance that you need to go after whatever it is that you are hesitant about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

                    <description>&lt;p&gt;How can you make yourself stand out in a crowd?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Are you catching the right person's attention?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, here is the show where you can figure that out. Our guest this week is Paul Oyer, author of Everything I Ever Needed to Know about Economics I Learned from Online Dating.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like our host James, Paul is an interesting guy who has found success by thinking outside the box.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paul shares his discoveries about the online dating world that he found to stem from economics.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After more than 20 years of marriage, Paul found himself swimming in the deep sea of the online dating scene...&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sure he was out of the game for some time &amp;ndash; older than the last time he was single &amp;ndash; but he did have an edge on the dating market... his economist's point of view.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He talks about his experiences in the online dating world that helped him learn how to stand out. It's all about signaling...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paul explains how he came to realize that the sites available out there are no different from the markets that he had spent a lifetime studying.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You'll hear how you can relate these ideas to your everyday life.&lt;/p&gt;

                    <description>&lt;p&gt;Ken Kurson, editor of The New York Observer, political consultant, journalist, and author, joins The James Altucher Show&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"You've created a 'Choose Yourself Career.'" Nobody could have just given you the career you've had. You've had to go and hunt for that career. You had to kill for that career. You made it up yourself as you went along.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This week, Ken Kurson, editor of The New York Observer, political consultant, journalist, and author, joins The James Altucher Show to talk about who will be the next President of the United States, the future of the media, and Ken's million-dollar deal that's still out there for the right entrepreneur to grab and run with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"Green was my one great idea in my life." There really is room, in my opinion, for a legitimate inheritor to the Greenmantle." &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;James and Ken then jump right into what it was like to work with America's Mayor, Rudy Guilliani. You'll get a firsthand look at what it's like running for President of the United States and what it takes to win.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;James asks Ken who he thinks the 2016 Republican and Democratic front runners are right now. You might be very surprised by his picks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They talk about getting rid of our two-party system because, as James says, "It doesn't seem to work at all. The candidates are very similar. I mean, in very rare cases, can I tell a difference in policy, actually, between Obama and Bush. It just seems like the two-party system and the lack of democracy, as you mentioned, is just a total failure."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But Ken disagrees&amp;hellip; "Yeah, I don't agree. I think the two-party system is a disaster except for all the other systems that have tried democracy which is an inversion of the old democracy is terrible except for all the other systems."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And so James offers up a brand-new, high-tech system that he believes could really help.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Plus, James asks Ken "So what's next in the media industry?" &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think you'll be very surprised by Ken's answer... &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"I don't think Twitter is the end of news. I believe we're kind of in a golden age of attention span. There's never been a time where people would watch 13 hours of beautifully written television in a row; the same show. I think it's really the beginning."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope you enjoy.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

                    <description>&lt;p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 13px; font-family: Verdana;"&gt;It's a question many of us are too afraid to answer..&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin: 0px 0px 11px; font-family: Verdana;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin: 0px 0px 11px; font-size: 13px; font-family: Verdana;"&gt;"Is this as good as it gets?"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 13px; font-family: Verdana;"&gt;Perhaps you feel that way from time to time. You get stuck in an unfulfilling job. You get stuck with a mortgage you can barely pay, in a house that didn't make you any happier than your previous home. You get stuck in a negative relationship. And you wonder if things will ever get better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 13px; font-family: Verdana;"&gt;James Altucher knows the feeling well. And in the latest episode of his radio show, he shows you exactly how to get "un-stuck" by making your negative life experiences work &lt;em&gt;for &lt;/em&gt;you instead of against you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 13px; font-family: Verdana;"&gt;The type of unconventional ideas you'll hear on his show made James a millionaire... and many of his guests have done the same.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 13px; font-family: Verdana;"&gt;This week's guest is no exception..&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 13px; font-family: Verdana;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;Dr. Wayne Dyer has seen plenty of obstacles in his life... but his attitude and belief in the power of self-reliance have earned him the title "father of motivation" by his fans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 13px; font-family: Verdana;"&gt;A hard worker since his first paper route at age 9, Dr. Dyer says, "There's never been a moment when I was unemployed, ever."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 13px; font-family: Verdana;"&gt;He was an orphan, served in the military, taught at a prestigious university, had eight children of his own, and made a comfortable life for himself in Hawaii.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 13px; font-family: Verdana;"&gt;To say he is influential is an understatement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin: 0px 0px 11px; font-family: Verdana;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 13px; font-family: Verdana;"&gt;His first book, &lt;em&gt;Your Erroneous Zones&lt;/em&gt;, was not only a &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; bestseller, but it sold more than 100 million copies in 47 languages... and was even smuggled to readers living behind the Iron Curtain of the 1980's.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin: 0px 0px 11px; font-family: Verdana;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 13px; font-family: Verdana;"&gt;He is one of the most prolific writers of our time. In fact, he has authored 40 books.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin: 0px 0px 11px; font-family: Verdana;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 13px; font-family: Verdana;"&gt;But like we mentioned earlier, some people really struggle with the feeling that their life is ordinary and unimportant...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin: 0px 0px 11px; font-family: Verdana;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 13px; font-family: Verdana;"&gt;James and Dr. Dyer explain why getting "un-stuck" is so important.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin: 0px 0px 11px; font-family: Verdana;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 13px; font-family: Verdana;"&gt;Dr. Dyer explains "If you're feeling stuck, your stuckness is going to have a physical impact on you... You're gonna get sick if you stay stuck."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin: 0px 0px 11px; font-family: Verdana;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 13px; font-family: Verdana;"&gt;More importantly, he shows you exactly how to get un-stuck, and live the life you were meant to lead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin: 0px 0px 11px; font-family: Verdana;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 13px; font-family: Verdana;"&gt;The tips and ideas Dr. Dyer discusses in the show are wide ranging.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin: 0px 0px 11px; font-family: Verdana;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 13px; font-family: Verdana;"&gt;From how to side-step fights with your wife... to avoiding the most common regret of the dying... Dr. Dyer's advice is well worth listening to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin: 0px 0px 11px; font-family: Verdana;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 13px; font-family: Verdana;"&gt;We&amp;rsquo;ll be the first to admit this was an intense show.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin: 0px 0px 11px; font-family: Verdana;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 13px; font-family: Verdana;"&gt;But Dr. Dyer is one of the most inspirational speakers in the world... And when combined with James' fascinating, original take on the world, the result is riveting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin: 0px 0px 11px; font-family: Verdana;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 13px; font-family: Verdana;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin: 0px 0px 11px; font-family: Verdana;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 13px; font-family: Verdana;"&gt;Enjoy!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

                    <description>&lt;p style="margin: 0px 0px 11px; font-size: 13px; font-family: Verdana;"&gt;You've heard the stories about college dropouts who go on to become billionaires... like Bill Gates, Steve Jobs, and Mark Zuckerburg...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin: 0px 0px 11px; font-size: 13px; font-family: Verdana;"&gt;And you might even know that 20% of America's millionaires never stepped foot on a college campus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin: 0px 0px 11px; font-size: 13px; font-family: Verdana;"&gt;But how many guys have you heard of who read at a second grade level... yet go on to be millionaires?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin: 0px 0px 11px; font-size: 13px; font-family: Verdana;"&gt;My guess is none... but you're about to meet one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin: 0px 0px 11px; font-size: 13px; font-family: Verdana;"&gt;His name is Lewis Howes, and he's this week's guest on the James Altucher Show, a radio show we recently helped to launch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin: 0px 0px 11px; font-size: 13px; font-family: Verdana;"&gt;Lewis Howes' story is nothing short of amazing...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin: 0px 0px 11px; font-size: 13px; font-family: Verdana;"&gt;At age 10, he was 6'3". He described himself as a "gangly, skinny, ugly, acne kid, who couldn't read or write or do anything."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin: 0px 0px 11px; font-size: 13px; font-family: Verdana;"&gt;In the eighth grade, he could only read at a second-grade level. He cheated on every test in high school because he says that's the only way he could pass.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin: 0px 0px 11px; font-size: 13px; font-family: Verdana;"&gt;But Lewis' life changed dramatically after talking his way into college. He wanted to become a football player... and despite a series of major setbacks and injuries, he became a &lt;em&gt;two-time All-American&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin: 0px 0px 11px; font-size: 13px; font-family: Verdana;"&gt;Thing is... when it came time to leave college, the NFL didn't want him. He had no other skills. He was broke and depressed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin: 0px 0px 11px; font-size: 13px; font-family: Verdana;"&gt;By now, you might be wondering how listening to a former semi-pro football player can help you become more successful and wealthy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin: 0px 0px 11px; font-size: 13px; font-family: Verdana;"&gt;Turns out, a lot more than you'd think... Howes figured out an ingenious way to make a fortune. At one time, he was making an incredible $60,000 per hour.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin: 0px 0px 11px; font-size: 13px; font-family: Verdana;"&gt;This week, you'll hear the amazing story of Lewis Howes, who now travels the globe teaching people exactly how they can achieve their dreams.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin: 0px 0px 11px; font-size: 13px; font-family: Verdana;"&gt;Schools can't prep you for success anymore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin: 0px 0px 11px; font-size: 13px; font-family: Verdana;"&gt;Today's millionaires prove that if schooling and traditional employment does not work for you, then you must figure out how to connect with people on a different level.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin: 0px 0px 11px; font-size: 13px; font-family: Verdana;"&gt;And Lewis teaches you exactly what you need to do to get there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin: 0px 0px 11px; font-size: 13px; font-family: Verdana;"&gt;He reveals the secret thing that people should &lt;span style="text-decoration: underline;"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;never, ever&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt; do when they're trying to get ahead. I was shocked because it's usually the first thing people think they SHOULD do!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin: 0px 0px 11px; font-size: 13px; font-family: Verdana;"&gt;He also reveals the question that he always asks during networking sessions. Lewis explains, "That simple question opened the door" to his future as a millionaire.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin: 0px 0px 11px; font-size: 13px; font-family: Verdana;"&gt;Like James Altucher, Lewis Howes is a quirky, interesting guy, who's become a huge success by thinking outside the box.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

                    <description>&lt;p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 13px; font-family: Verdana;"&gt;On this week's show, James and Aaron Brabham chat with Ylon Schwartz: poker champion, chess master, and gamer extraordinaire.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 13px; font-family: Verdana;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 13px; font-family: Verdana;"&gt;He is without a doubt one of the most intriguing characters you're ever likely to encounter...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 13px; font-family: Verdana;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 13px; font-family: Verdana;"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;College Dropout Who Has Never Had a Real Job Wins $8 Million in Cash at the Poker Table...&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 13px; font-family: Verdana;"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 13px; font-family: Verdana;"&gt;If you watched the 2008 World Series of Poker, you may remember Ylon Schwartz and his trademark curly locks...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 13px; font-family: Verdana;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 13px; font-family: Verdana;"&gt;The day before the championship, Ylon was drowning in debt and in trouble with the law back in his hometown of New York City. From rock bottom, he redirected years of frustrations about money and women, channeling it towards winning the game...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 13px; font-family: Verdana;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 13px; font-family: Verdana;"&gt;... and walked out of the Las Vegas Rio Casino with a cool $3.7 million in his pocket.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 13px; font-family: Verdana;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 13px; font-family: Verdana;"&gt;In fact, Ylon has won an estimated $8 million in cash, just from playing poker. Not bad for a college dropout who has never held a job.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 13px; font-family: Verdana;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 13px; font-family: Verdana;"&gt;Today, he's one of the most widely recognized and well-respected poker players in the world.&lt;span style="font-size: 11px;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>
