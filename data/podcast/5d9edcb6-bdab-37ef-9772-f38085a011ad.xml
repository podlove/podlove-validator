You can find every podcast episode I&amp;#8217;ve done, going all the way back to March 2009. We&amp;#8217;ve covered a lot of ground, from totally practical nuts-and-bolts strategies to more thought-provoking topics that will give you a deeper understanding of ADHD. I love all of it, so hopefully you&amp;#8217;ll find just what you need.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also have information here about my three books and a seminar recording, as well as information about upcoming presentations I&amp;#8217;m doing, links to past presentations, and some other cool events that you may be interested in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;A Million Things to Make Your Life Better&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[From the introduction to &lt;em&gt;More Attention, Less Deficit: Success Strategies for Adults with ADHD&lt;/em&gt;]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whenever I meet a new client with ADHD, I always feel compelled to tell her a million things that can help her understand her ADHD and enjoy life more. This book and this podcast is those million things. It&amp;#8217;s everything I want to tell new clients and audiences at presentations. It&amp;#8217;s incredibly interesting and extremely important. This is the kind of information that can change your life. Yes, I will be that bold to say that it can change your life. It won&amp;#8217;t change everything, but it can change a lot. You will do some things differently, and you will feel different about some of the things that stay the same. Knowledge has that kind of power.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I was writing this book, I kept coming back to the idea that life is different after being diagnosed with ADHD. ADHD can make your life really difficult-before you know what&amp;#8217;s tripping you up. Once you know it&amp;#8217;s ADHD, life gets much easier. Then you know what you&amp;#8217;re wrestling with and can start to get a hold of it. Then it becomes a fair fight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The goal here is merely to tilt the odds of success, to make you more likely to do the right thing at the right time. Not all the time, but most of the time. Not perfect, but better. ADHD takes away your ability to be consistent, so the information and strategies in this book and in this podcast are here to give you back some of that consistency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this introductory podcast, we talk about this podcast, the book &lt;em&gt;More Attention, Less Deficit&lt;/em&gt;, and why learning about ADHD is so important.&lt;/p&gt;

A Million Things to Make Your Life Better
[From the introduction to More Attention, Less Deficit: Success Strategies for Adults with ADHD]

Whenever I meet a new client with ADHD, I always feel compelled to tell her a million things that can help her understand her ADHD and enjoy life more. This book and this podcast is those million things. It's everything I want to tell new clients and audiences at presentations. It's incredibly interesting and extremely important. This is the kind of information that can change your life. Yes, I will be that bold to say that it can change your life. It won't change everything, but it can change a lot. You will do some things differently, and you will feel different about some of the things that stay the same. Knowledge has that kind of power.

As I was writing this book, I kept coming back to the idea that life is different after being diagnosed with ADHD. ADHD can make your life really difficult-before you know what's tripping you up. Once you know it's ADHD, life gets much easier. Then you know what you're wrestling with and can start to get a hold of it. Then it becomes a fair fight.

The goal here is merely to tilt the odds of success, to make you more likely to do the right thing at the right time. Not all the time, but most of the time. Not perfect, but better. ADHD takes away your ability to be consistent, so the information and strategies in this book and in this podcast are here to give you back some of that consistency.

In this introductory podcast, we talk about this podcast, the book More Attention, Less Deficit, and why learning about ADHD is so important.

Fortunately, you don&amp;#8217;t have to attribute them to your ADHD in order to feel good about yourself.</description>
